## Introduction

The TMS Afriyie web application is a patient-facing application that offers healthcare-focused financial solutions and skills such as savings and budgeting whilst leveraging insights from their healthcare journey, especially during pregnancy, childbirth and the first years of life of their children. <br/>
Health is wealth but in emerging economies wealth can also mean the difference between good and bad. Afriyie is therefore an Out-of-the-box approach to health premised on the fact that finance is a determinant of health.
